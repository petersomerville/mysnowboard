# My Snowboard 🏂

A browser-based snowboarding game where you name your rider, pick tricks, and try to survive the mountain.

## How to Play

1. **Intro** — Name your snowboarder and choose a color
2. **Top of the Hill** — Pick a trick: Basic Grab (80%), 360 Spin (55%), or Backflip (30%)
3. **The Jump** — Watch the animation and see if you land it
4. **The Chalet** — Spend coins on Cheese Curds or Hot Chocolate to restore health, then go again

Game over when your health hits zero. Go for the highest coin total!
